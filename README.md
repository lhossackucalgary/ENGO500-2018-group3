# ENGO 500 Group 3

## Executive Summary

Create a web-app that integrates with OS and end-user services across various devices to display spatially-enabled information about the health of systems, prioritize systems' up-time by some heuristic, provide efficient routing for members of a maintenance team, and allow additional data visualization of the systems being monitored over time (including tabs on historic data).

We may simulate the data, or find freely available data for this.

Specific technologies to consider (This shouldn't be part of the exec summary)
- vector map tiles for caching (must find efficient way to load large datasets to web-app)
(Basically we need to create a web-based system capable of serving the data efficiently, and to perform DAV, and on the front end to display the data nice & pretty)
