## Executive Summary

Many companies have assets that are dispersed across large geographic areas. When these assets fail or require maintenance, crews need to perform repairs efficiently to reduce downtime. Equipment malfunctions may be preceded by weak signals that can be analyzed or transmitted by IoT sensors. Additionally, some equipment may have higher economic priority than other equipment, and thus is a higher priority to be repaired in the case of simultaneous malfunctions. Of course, there are costs associated with having maintenance crews traveling more than necessary. That is, travel time costs companies money in wages as well as fuel and wear on vehicles. Our solution provides a web interface for both data analytics, visualization and control of the network for maintenance crew management, as well as an economically optimized route planning and optimization tool for crews on the ground. The visualization and control interface allows historic data to be presented and interpreted, to help identify patterns in failures over time, geographically, and otherwise. Additionally this control interface will allow priorities and meta-data to be set for nodes in the network. The route planning tool is built to optimize time usage by maintenance crews by reducing travel time between machinery, and prioritizing repairs on higher value machinery.
